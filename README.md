# sa-services
Schema-centric abstraction on top of SqlAlchemy core libs.

This provides a set of methods to perform CRUD database operations.

Includes some useful, most commonly used functions like `find`, `find_all`, `paginate`, and so on.

To give it a try, just install the SqlAlchemy libs through pip (on a virtual environment, preferably):
```
pip install sqlalchemy
```
