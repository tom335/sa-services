# sa-services
Schema-centric abstraction on top of [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) core libs.

It provides a set of methods to perform CRUD database operations.

Also, includes some useful, commonly used functions like `find`, `find_all`, `paginate`, and so on.

To give it a try, just install the SqlAlchemy libs through pip (on a virtual environment, preferably):
```
pip install sqlalchemy
```

There's a `tests.py` file with some usage examples. To see how it works, run it:
```
python tests.py
```
